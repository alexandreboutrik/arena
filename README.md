Arena is a collection of Brazilian card games developed in C99 using the Raylib library, currently in its very early development phase. The first alpha release will feature the popular game Fodinha, with plans to expand further. The current codebase is a bit messy, and it will undergo significant refactoring to improve structure and readability.

## Development status
